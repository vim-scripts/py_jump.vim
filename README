The title says it all - this script enhances a % command in python to make it jump not only between ([{}]) brackets, but also between start and end of the indented block - just like it does for {} in C++ and perl.

The script also uses some tricks to guess the _beginning_ of the indented block when jumping backwards. Try to use % several times for a deeply nested block to check it out.

Enjoy!
